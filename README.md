# DHCP Discover attack

## Introduccion yersinia

With Yersinia, besides being able to carry out DHCP attacks, we can do many other things; however, in this case, weâ€™ll perform the Discover attack, which is the most basic and easiest of all.
What we need is to have Kali Linux and, for ethical reasons, a DHCP server that does not limit incoming Discover packets so we can observe how the program operates.

## How to attack

First we install yersinia.
```
sudo apt install yersinia
```
